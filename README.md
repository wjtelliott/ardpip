# PipBoy Arduino

This project uses the following hardware:

- Arduino Mega 2560
- Rotary pins with click switch
- Standard 10k resistors
- Standard LED lights
- TFT ILI9886 with integrated shield

Hook up the pins according to the `pins.h` file

This imports a custom library named `TFT-HX8357`, which is required and can be found here on github
